# Session 2

## Overview

In this week, we focused on the **basic principles of computer architecture**. We started by learning about the **classic Von-Neumann architecture**.

### Basic Input-Process-Output System

The basic **input-process-output** system includes:
- **External mass storage**
- **Control units**
- **Instruction registers**

### Typical Non-Von Neumann Architecture

A typical non-Von Neumann architecture consists of **three buses**:

1. **Data Bus**:
   - Moves data efficiently within the system.
   - **Bi-directional** (data can move both ways).

2. **Control Bus**:
   - Carries control signals to manage CPU operations.
   - **Bi-directional**.

3. **Address Bus**:
   - Specifies the memory location.
   - **Uni-directional** (data flows in one direction).

## Types of Memory

### On-CPU Memory

#### Disadvantages:
1. Small size.
2. Expensive.

#### Advantages:
1. Extremely fast.
2. Low latency.

#### Types:
1. **Registers**
2. **Cache Memory**

### Off-CPU Memory

#### Disadvantages:
1. Slower.
2. High latency.

#### Advantages:
1. Larger capacity.
2. Cost-effective.

#### Types:
1. **ROM**
2. **Hard Drive**

## CPU Types

There are two main types of CPUs:

1. **RISC** (Reduced Instruction Set Computer)
   - Example: **Raspberry Pi**

2. **CISC** (Complex Instruction Set Computer)
   - Example: **Intel Processor**

## Logic Gates and Binary Operations

We also learned about the following **gates** and their **binary operations**:

- **NOT Gate**
- **NAND Gate**
- **AND Gate**
- **OR Gate**
- **NOR Gate**
- **XOR Gate**
- **XNOR Gate**

We worked on creating **truth tables** for these gates and discussed how smaller gates are used to create complex operations within the CPU.

## Floating Point and Two-Component Systems

We explored the concept of **floating point** representation and its two components.

## Binary Operations

We also practiced different **binary operations**, including:
1. **Decimal to Hexadecimal Conversion** and vice versa.
2. **Binary multiplication** and **division** exercises were done in class.
