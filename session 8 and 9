# **Session 8 and 9: Introduction to Networking**

In this session, we learned about networking and how devices connect to the internet.

## **IP Addressing and Communication**
- Computers use **IP addresses** to communicate with each other, breaking the address into separate bytes.
- **Routers** play a crucial role in connecting devices and routing packets across networks to their final destinations.

## **Network Protocol Layers**
A **network protocol** is a set of rules and conventions that enable devices on a network to communicate with each other. Each layer in the protocol stack has its own protocol, and in a well-designed system, these protocols work together.

### **OSI 7-Layer Model**
The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection)** 7-layer model is one of the most comprehensive models for understanding network communication.

1. **Application Layer (Layer 7)**
   - The Application Layer defines how data is transferred to make specific applications work.
   - **Examples**: HTTP, SSH, FTP
   
2. **Transport Layer (Layer 4)**
   - The Transport Layer defines the quality and management of the data connection between the application and its destination.
   
3. **Network Layer (Layer 3)**
   - The Network Layer is used for communication across a network consisting of multiple link layer segments. It manages the routing and forwarding of data.

4. **Link Layer (Layer 2)**
   - The Link Layer is responsible for local, point-to-point communication, where devices send signals directly to each other over a physical medium.
   - It connects separate link layer segments to form an end-to-end network.
