# Session 3 & 4

## Overview

In these sessions, we delved deeper into **computer architecture** and gained more insight into **Raspberry Pi** and how it interacts with the outside world.

The Raspberry Pi consists of several components, but the **heart** of the Pi is the **BoardCam**, which is the **System on Chip (SoC)** and contains 4 CPU cores. 

### Main Components of the Raspberry Pi:
1. **Memory Unit**
2. **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)**
3. **USB Ports**
4. **GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output)**

## More on GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output)

- The **GPIO** on the Raspberry Pi has **40 pins** for input and output.
- Each pin is labeled from **GPIO-0** to **GPIO-25**, and each pin has a specific function. Some pins are used for **serial ports** or **clocks**.
- **GPIO** allows flexibility to control and communicate with external devices.

### Programming GPIO:
Programming with GPIO can be complex, and to make it easier, several tools are used. Apps like **Node-RED** can be used to interact with GPIO and control external devices, such as lights.

## Experimenting with GPIO and Raspberry Pi

To experiment with GPIO and Raspberry Pi, we use the **Gertboard**, which simplifies the GPIO programming process.

### What is Gertboard?
The **Gertboard** is a **pre-assembled input/output board** designed to facilitate GPIO experiments with the Raspberry Pi.

### What is WiringPi?
**WiringPi** is a software library that simplifies GPIO manipulation in the Raspberry Pi.

To use **WiringPi**, you need to install the **32-bit package** on the Pi. Since the network was slow, we downloaded the package from **GitHub** and installed it via USB.

## Setting Up the Gertboard and WiringPi

### Gertboard Setup:

We connected the **Gertboard** to the Raspberry Pi using a **ribbon cable** and the GPIO pins. Below is how the GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi map to the WiringPi pins:

| **GPIO Pin** | **WiringPi Pin (WPI)** |
|--------------|------------------------|
| GPIO-21      | WPI 29                 |
| GPIO-18      | WPI 1                  |
| GPIO-17      | WPI 0                  |
| GPIO-10      | WPI 12                 |
| GPIO-9       | WPI 13                 |
| GPIO-8       | WPI 10                 |
| GPIO-7       | WPI 11                 |
| GPIO-4       | WPI 7                  |

We connected the **GP Link** to **J2** on the Gertboard.

### GPIO Pin Connections for Gertboard:

| **GPIO Pin** | **Gertboard Pin** |
|--------------|-------------------|
| GP25         | B1                |
| GP24         | B2                |
| GP23         | B3                |
| GP22         | B4                |
| GP21         | B5                |
| GP18         | B6                |
| GP17         | B7                |
| GP15         | B8                |
| GP14         | B9                |
| GP11         | B10               |
| GP10         | B11               |
| GP9          | B12               |

## Testing Input and Output

### GPIO Commands:
- To test the GPIO pins, use the command:
  ```bash
  gpio readall
### Testing GPIO Input and Output

- To **blink an LED** connected to GPIO pin 22, use the following command:
  ```bash
  gpio -g blink 22

**Note**: Before setting the pin to **output mode**, make sure to first set it to **input mode**.
